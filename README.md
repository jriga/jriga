# Jerome Riga

Hey there! I'm a Senior Software Engineer who loves diving into challenging projects. I've spent years honing my skills in agile environments, where adaptability and quick thinking are key.

My programming toolkit is pretty diverse - I'm fluent in Ruby and Python for backend work and I really enjoy crafting smooth user experiences on the frontend.

Throughout my career, I've had the exciting opportunity to work across various industries. From the dynamic world of startups to the impactful realm of government digital services, I've seen firsthand how technology can make a real difference. It's always a thrill to build efficient, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.

One thing that keeps me going is my passion for learning. The tech world is always evolving, and I'm right there with it! I love picking up new skills and applying them to tackle complex challenges. Whether it's a new framework, language, or methodology, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and see how it can improve my work.
